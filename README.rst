django-hide-herokuapp
=====================

Django app for Heroku users designed to hide your ``*.herokuapp.com``
from search engine results.

Use case
--------

You want to develop a website called ``artisanalraisinbeer.com`` using
Django deployed on Heroku. You write a little bit of Django code and
create a new Heroku app called ``artisanalraisinbeer`` to deploy to.

While developing, you can visit your site by going to this URL:
``http://artisanalraisinbeer.herokuapp.com``

Eventually, you finish the first version of your website, buy the
domain name `artisanalraisinbeer.com`, and set everything up
so that you can view the site just by going to the following URL:
``http://www.artisanalraisinbeer.com``

You can still visit ``http://artisanalraisinbeer.herokuapp.com``, which
is fineâ€”but there's one problem: you want your main site to show
up in search results, *not* your ``.herokuapp.com`` site.

How it works
------------

This app goes about this two ways: `robots.txt <http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html>`_
and the `X-Robots-Tag <https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_meta_tag>`_.
Why both? *To be double-plus sure...* :eyes:

If ``herokuapp`` seems to be in the `originating host`_
of the user request, then we do two things:

* Put the following in ``robots.txt``::

      User-agent: *
      Disallow: /
    
* Set ``X-Robots-Tag`` in our response header to ``noindex, nofollow``.

For search engines that respect these settings, they should start to ignore these sites
in future crawls.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add ``'hide_herokuapp'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

2. Add the ``HideHerokuappFromRobotsMiddleware`` middleware to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``
   like this::
   
     MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
         ...
         'hide_herokuapp.middleware.HideHerokuappFromRobotsMiddleware',
     )
   

3. Include the ``hide_herokuapp`` URLs in your project's ``urls.py`` like this::
   

      urlpatterns = [
         ...
         url(r'^', include('hide_herokuapp.urls')),
         ...
      ]
   
   alternatively, you may hook up the view directly::

      from hide_herokuapp.views import herokuapp_robots_view

      urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^robots\.txt$', herokuapp_robots_view),
        ...
      ]
